# CoimbraUniversity

Literature was also benefited in the reign of Dom Denis I, who founded the country's first university, which operated in Lisbon and was later transferred to Coimbra. It gave clergy and laity study opportunities.
Poet and protector of troubadours and minstrels, he composed several songs distributed by all genres: 73 Cantigas de Amor, 51 Cantigas de Amigo, and 10 Cantigas de Escárnio and Maldizer. He was the first king of Portugal to sign his documents with his full name.

I was an even better singer than a king... You guys should have seen me with the ladies!

The Papal confirmation was also given in 1290, during the Papacy of Pope Nicholas IV. In accordance with the Papal Bull, all the «licit» Faculties, with the exception of that of Theology, could be established. Thus the Faculties of Arts, Law, Canon Law, and Medicine were the first to be created. This town already had old traditions in education, being home to the highly successful school of the Monastery of Santa Cruz. The university was then established on the site known as «Estudos Velhos», which corresponds roughly to the area where the Main Library now stands.

In 1338, during the reign of Afonso IV, it was once again transferred to Lisbon, from whence it returned in 1354, this time to the center of the town which was then in full expansion. In 1537, during the reign of João III, the university moved definitively to Coimbra, where it was installed in the Alcaçova Palace which was subsequently purchased from the Royal Family in 1597.
The university institution, including all the books from its library, was moved from Lisbon to Coimbra. Teachers were not guaranteed a position at the new location and many did not move; in fact, most of the new faculty was previously with the University of Salamanca.
