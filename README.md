# CoimbraUniversity

Literature was also benefited in the reign of Dom Denis I, who founded the country's first university, which operated in Lisbon and was later transferred to Coimbra. It gave clergy and laity study opportunities.
Poet and protector of troubadours and minstrels, he composed several songs distributed by all genres: 73 Cantigas de Amor, 51 Cantigas de Amigo, and 10 Cantigas de Escárnio and Maldizer. He was the first king of Portugal to sign his documents with his full name.

I was an even better singer than a king... You guys should have seen me with the ladies!

The Papal confirmation was also given in 1290, during the Papacy of Pope Nicholas IV. In accordance with the Papal Bull, all the «licit» Faculties, with the exception of that of Theology, could be established. Thus the Faculties of Arts, Law, Canon Law, and Medicine were the first to be created. This town already had old traditions in education, being home to the highly successful school of the Monastery of Santa Cruz. The university was then established on the site known as «Estudos Velhos», which corresponds roughly to the area where the Main Library now stands.
